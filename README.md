Battle-arena dapp

A few notes:

- Do not attempt to use the sandbox for development with this dapp - just use g:update and develop on the ghostnet. There are some references to mainnet and sandbox in this repo, but this functionality has been removed. 
- The use of beacon and taquito for subscribing to the wallet pairing and events is out of date in this repo
- To update the contract, you must edit battlemaster.arl, then update the contract on the ghostnet with `yarn g:update` then run `yarn dapp-bind` in the the backend workspace. 
- To test the contract before updating the contract on the chain, you can run `yarn test-bind` and then run the test suite.
- Unfortunately, archetype has limited support for events, and for this reason hacky changes must be made to the created bindings in battlemaster.ts. The updated classes can be found in the bindings foldres, and the "swap_classes.pl" file swaps these hacky changed bindings for the broken bindings generated by archetype. Hopefully archetype will properly support events emitting more complex structures at some point and this can be removed. If contract tests fail, this may be due to incompatibility between the bindings and the hacky changes.

This is a repo for an educational game called battle-arena that is a part of some learning material to help people to learn about the tezos ecosystem. This involves playing a humorous game where you attempt to defeat the creator of the battle arena dapp by understanding how the contract behind the dapp works and taking advantage of some poor decisions made by the dapps fictional creator to defeat the battle master of the battle arena.
